We have the numbers 21, 5, and 11, and we need to make 76 using each exactly once with basic operations.\n\nFirst, I'll try combining the numbers in different ways. Let's check multiplication first since it can reach higher numbers quickly. 21 * 5 is 105, which is already over 76. Then 105 - 11 = 94, not helpful. What if I do 21 + 5? That's 26, then 26 * 11 is 286, way too big.\n\nHow about 11 + 5 = 16, then 21 * 16 = 336. No. Maybe division? 21 / 5 is 4.2, not helpful. 11 / 5 is 2.2. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe combining numbers with subtraction. Let's try 21 * (11 - 5) = 21 * 6 = 126. Still too high. 126 - 5 = 121, no. 21 * (11 - (5/...)) but we need to use each number once. Wait, maybe 21 * 5 - 11? 105 - 11 = 94. Not 76.\n\nWhat about 11 * 5 = 55, then 55 + 21 = 76! Oh, that works. So 11 * 5 + 21 = 55 + 21 = 76. Each number used once, operations are multiplication and addition. So the equation is <answer>(11 * 5) + 21</answer>", "numbers": [21, 5, 11], "target": 76.0, "reward": 1.0, "equation": "(11 * 5) + 21", "result": 76.0}

I need to use each number once: 74, 24, 37, and get 22. Let's try combinations. Maybe subtract or divide. 74 - 24 is 50, then 50 - 37 is 13. Not enough. What if I multiply? 24 / 37 is not helpful. Maybe 74 - (37 + 24) = 74 - 61 = 13. Still no. How about 37 - 24 = 13, then 74 - 13 = 61. No. Maybe 74 - (something) = 22. 74 - x = 22 → x=52. Can I make 52 with 24 and 37? 24 + 37 = 61, too much. 37 + 24 = 61. 61 - something? Not sure. What if I divide? 74 / 24 is about 3.08, not helpful. 37 / 24 is ~1.54. Hmm. Wait, maybe 24 - (37 - 74) = 24 - (-37) = 61. No. Another approach: 37 - (74 / 24) ≈ 37 - 3.08 ≈ 33.92. Not helpful. What about 74 - 37 = 37, then 37 - 24 = 13. No. Maybe 24 - (74 / 37) = 24 - 2 = 22! Wait, 74 divided by 37 is 2. So 24 - 2 = 22. Yes! So the equation would be 24 - (74 / 37) = 22. Let me check: 74 ÷ 37 is 2, then 24 - 2 is 22.

Not helpful. What if I multiply? 36 + 59 is 95. 95 - 86 is 9. Not 63. How about 86 - (36 + 59)? That's 86 - 95 = -9. No. Maybe 59 + 36 = 95. 95 - 86 = 9. Still no.
