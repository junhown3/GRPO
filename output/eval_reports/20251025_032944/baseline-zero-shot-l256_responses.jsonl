That would need 1, but I don't have 1. Alternatively, maybe 73 plus 1, but I need to get 1 from the other numbers. Wait, the other numbers are 8, 48, 40. Let me see. If I take 48 and 40, maybe 48 - 40 is 8. But I already have an 8. Hmm, maybe that's a way to use them. Wait, but each number can only be used once.

Wait, the example given uses all four numbers, but in this case, maybe I need to use all three numbers.

Hmm, 58 - 49 is 9. So 29 + 9 is 38. Not helpful. Alternatively, 53 - (something)...\n\nWait, maybe multiplication? Let's think.

For example, 86 minus 36 is 50. Then 50 plus 59 would be 109, which is too high. Hmm. What if I do 59 minus 36? That's 23. Then 86 minus 23 is 63. Wait, that's 86 - (59 - 36) = 86 - 23 = 63. Let me check that. 59 minus 36 is 23, then 86 minus 23 is indeed 63. So that uses all three numbers: 86, 59, and 36. Each once. So the equation would be 86 - (59 - 36) = 63.
