Maybe 88 - 75 = 13, then 75 - 13 = 62. Close to 63. Then 62 + 1 = 63, but where to get 1? 75 / 75 = 1. So 88 - 75 = 13, 75 - 13 = 62, 62 + (75/75) = 63. That uses all numbers: 88, 75, 75, 63. Wait, but 75 is used twice here. Oh no, the numbers are [63, 75, 75, 88], so each number can be used once. So using 75 twice isn't allowed. \n\nWait, maybe 88 - (75 / 75) = 88 - 1 = 87. Then 87 - 63 = 24. Not helpful. \n\nHow about 75 - (88 - 63) = 75 - 25 = 50. Then 50 + 75 = 125. No. \n\nAlternatively, (88 - 75) + (75 - 63) = 13 + 12 = 25.
