But that's way too big. Alternatively, 72 - 34 is 38. Close to 39. If I have 38 plus 1 (from 84-83), that's 39. Wait, but then I would need to use 84 and 83 once each, and 34 and 72 once each.

Let me think about how to combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, 94 is a large number. If I add 4 and 1, that's 5. But 94 + 5 is 99, which is close to 97 but not quite. Maybe subtract something? Wait, 94 plus something equals 97. That would require adding 3. But how to get 3 from 4 and 1? 4 - 1 is 3. So maybe 94 + (4 - 1) = 97. Let me check: 94 + 3 is 97. Yes! That works. But wait, the numbers are 94, 4, and 1. So using 94, 4, and 1 each once. The equation would be 94 + (4 - 1) = 97. That uses all three numbers once. Let me verify: 4-1 is 3, plus 94 is 97. Perfect. So the answer would be 94 + 4 - 1. But wait, the order matters here. Since addition is left associative, but the equation is 94 + (4 - 1). But the user might expect the standard order, but as long as the operations are correctly applied, it's okay. So the final equation is 94 + 4 - 1. Alternatively, 94 + (4 - 1) is the same as 94 + 4 - 1. So that's valid. Let me check if there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Yeah, that should work.\n</think>\n\nThe goal is to use each number once (94, 4, 1) with basic operations to reach 97.  \n\nFirst, note that 94 + 4 = 98. To reduce from 98 to 97, subtract 1. Thus:  \n**94 + 4 - 1 = 97**  \n\nThis uses all numbers exactly once and follows the required operations.  \n\n<answer>94 + 4 - 1</answer>", "numbers": [94, 4, 1], "target": 97.0, "reward": 1.0, "equation": "94 + 4 - 1", "result": 97.0}

Let's see: 92 is the largest. If I subtract 26 from 92, that's 66. Then 66 plus 48 would be 114, which is way over. Not helpful. What if I subtract 48 from 92? That's 44. Then 44 plus 26 is 70. Wait, that's 44 + 26 = 70. But then I used 92 and 48, and 26. Wait, but the numbers are [92, 26, 48]. So if I do 92 - 48 = 44, then 44 + 26 = 70. That uses all three numbers. So the equation would be (92 - 48) + 26. Let me check: 92-48 is 44, plus 26 is 70. Yes! That works. So the equation is (92 - 48) + 26 = 70. But wait, the problem says each number can be used once. So that uses all three numbers once each. So that's valid. So the answer would be (92 - 48) + 26. Let me check again: 92 - 48 is 44, plus 26 is 70. Yep, that's correct. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nTo solve the problem, we need to use each number [92, 26, 48] exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach 70. \n\nFirst, observe that 92 - 48 = 44.

I need to use the numbers 92, 11, and 19 to make 62. Each number can only be used once. Let me think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract or add some numbers. Let's check the total sum: 92 + 11 + 19 is 122. That's way higher than 62. So maybe I need to subtract or divide.\n\nWhat if I subtract 92 from something? 62 is 92 minus 30. But how to get 30 from 11 and 19? 11 + 19 is 30. Oh! So 92 - (11 + 19) = 92 - 30 = 62. Wait, that works. Let me check: 11 + 19 is 30, then 92 - 30 is 62. Yes! So the equation would be 92 - 11 - 19. But wait, that's 92 -11 is 81, minus 19 is 62. Yes. But the problem says each number can be used once. So using 92, 11, and 19 once each. So the equation is 92 - 11 - 19 = 62. Alternatively, maybe parentheses to show the order, but the operations are subtraction. So the answer would be 92 - 11 - 19. Let me check if that's correct. 92 minus 11 is 81, minus 19 is 62. Yep. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nTo solve 92 - 11 - 19 = 62, we start by calculating the sum of 11 and 19, which is 30. Subtracting this from 92 gives 62.

I need to use the numbers 44, 2, and 8 to make 14. Each number can only be used once. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the operations. Since 14 is not too big, maybe dividing or subtracting could help. Let's try some ideas.\n\nIf I take 44 and subtract something. 44 minus 8 is 36. Then 36 minus 2 is 34. No, that's too big. What if I add 2 and 8 first? 2 + 8 is 10. Then 44 minus 10 is 34. Still not 14.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication? Let's see. 44 divided by something? 44 divided by 2 is 22. Then 22 minus 8 is 14. Wait, that works! Let me check: 44 / 2 is 22, then 22 - 8 is 14. Yes! So the equation would be 44 / 2 - 8 = 14. But wait, the numbers are 44, 2, 8. Each used once. Yes, that's valid. So the answer is (44 / 2) - 8. Let me confirm the calculation: 44 divided by 2 is 22, minus 8 is 14. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we aim to use the numbers [44, 2, 8] exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach 14.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- Start by dividing 44 by 2: $ \\frac{44}{2} = 22 $.  \n- Subtract 8 from the result: $ 22 - 8 = 14 $.  \n\nThis uses all three numbers once and achieves the target value.  \n\n<answer>(44 / 2) - 8</answer>", "numbers": [44, 2, 8], "target": 14.0, "reward": 1.0, "equation": "(44 / 2) - 8", "result": 14.0}

Wait, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAnother approach: adding two numbers and then subtracting the third. Let's try 82 + 89 = 171. Then 171 - 90 would be 81, which is too low. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 90 - 82? That's 8. Then 89 + 8 = 97. Oh! Wait, that works. So 90 - 82 is 8, then adding 89 gives 97. Let me check: 90 - 82 = 8, 8 + 89 = 97. Yes! And each number is used once. So the equation would be (90 - 82) + 89. But I need to make sure that the order of operations is correct.
