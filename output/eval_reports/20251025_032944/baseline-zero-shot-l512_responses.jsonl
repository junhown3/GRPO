Let me check: 18 divided by 6 is 3. 48 minus 3 is 45. Yes! And each number is used once: 48, 18, and 6. That's exactly what's needed. So the equation would be 48 - (18 / 6) = 45.

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can find some way to reduce these numbers. Since 14 is a relatively small number, perhaps dividing or subtracting larger numbers could help. Let's consider the differences between the numbers. For example, 98 - 78 is 20. Then 71 - 20 is 51. That's not helpful. Alternatively, 78 - 71 is 7. Then 98 - 7 = 91. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the third. Let's try 78 divided by something. 78 divided by 98 is less than 1, but maybe not. Alternatively, 98 minus something equals 14. Let's see, 98 - x = 14 → x = 84. So if I can get 84 from 71 and 78. 78 + 71 is 149, which is too big. 71 - 78 is -7. Not helpful. 78 - 71 is 7. So 98 - (78 - 71) = 98 -7 = 91. Still not 14.\n\nWhat if I multiply two numbers? 71 + 78 is 149. Then 149 - 98 is 51. Not 14. 98 + 71 is 169. 169 -78 is 91. Not helpful. 78 + 98 is 176. 176 -71 is 105. No.\n\nWait, perhaps division? Let's think. 98 divided by something. 98 divided by 7 is 14. But how to get 7 from 71 and 78? 78 - 71 is 7. So 98 / (78 - 71) = 98 /7 =14. Oh! That works.

Wait, but I need to use all three numbers. So 96 - 19 = 77, and then 77 - 1 = 76. That uses all three numbers: 96, 19, and 1. So the equation would be 96 - 19 - 1. Let me check that. 96 minus 19 is 77, minus 1 is 76. Yes, that works. So the equation is 96 - 19 - 1. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. Are there other ways? Maybe using multiplication or division? Let's see. For example, 19 * 1 is 19, then 96 - 19 = 77, again 77 -1 =76. But that's the same as before. Alternatively, 96 divided by something? 96 divided by 1 is 96, then 19 plus that would be 115, which is too big. Or maybe 19 + 1 =20, then 96 -20=76. Oh, wait, that's another way.

Let me check if both are acceptable. The first one is 96 -19 -1, which is straightforward. The second is 96 -19 -1, same thing. So either way, the answer is the same. So I can choose either.

Let's try 47 + 13 = 60. Then 60 - 52 = 8. Still not 43. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe multiply some numbers? 13 * 52 is way too big. 47 + 13 = 60, 52 - 60 = -8. Not useful. How about 52 - 47 = 5. Then 13 - 5 = 8. No.\n\nAnother approach: 43 is a prime number. Maybe I need to use division or subtraction to get there. Let's see. If I can get 47 and 52 to some value that when subtracted or added gives 43. For example, 52 - 13 = 39. Then 47 - 39 = 8. Not helpful. Or 47 - (52 - 13) = 47 - 39 = 8. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe 52 - (47 - 13) = 52 - 34 = 18. No. What if I do 47 - (52 / something)? Let's see. 52 divided by 13 is 4. So 47 - 4 = 43. Oh! That works. Let me check: 52 divided by 13 is 4. Then 47 minus that is 43. So the equation would be 47 - (52 / 13) = 43. But wait, do I have to use all three numbers?

If I can flip the sign, maybe. But how? If I do (16 + 27) - 61 = -18. To get 18, maybe multiply by -1? But that would require an extra operation. Wait, but I can only use each number once. So maybe (16 + 27) - 61 = -18, and then add 36? But I don't have 36. Wait, but I have to use all three numbers once. So maybe another approach.\n\nWhat if I subtract 61 from 27? 27 - 61 is -34. Then add 16? -34 +16 = -18. Same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying. 16 times 27 is 432. Divided by 61? Let's see, 432 divided by 61 is about 7.08.

I have the numbers 91, 1, and 23. I need to make an equation that equals 68 using each number once. Let's think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, 91 and 23 are both large numbers. If I subtract them, 91 - 23 is 68. Wait, that's exactly the target! But then I have the number 1 left. Oh right, each number must be used once. So if I do 91 - 23, that's 68, but I still have the 1 left. How can I use the 1? Maybe I need to incorporate it into the equation somehow. But if I just do 91 - 23, it's 68, but the problem says each number must be used once. So maybe the 1 is part of the equation in a way that doesn't change the result. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I can use the 1 in a division or multiplication that cancels out. For example, if I do 91 - 23 - 1, that's 67, which is close but not 68. Or 91 - 23 + 1 = 69, which is over. Alternatively, maybe multiplying 1 by something. But 1 times anything is just that number. So maybe 91 - 23 = 68, and then 1 is unused. But the problem requires using all three numbers. So I need to find a way to include the 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the 1 in a division. Like 91 - (23 / 1). But 23 divided by 1 is 23, so 91 - 23 is 68. But then that uses 91, 23, and 1. Wait, that would be 91 - (23 / 1) = 68. Let me check that. 23 divided by 1 is 23, subtracted from 91 gives 68. Yes! So that uses all three numbers once each.

Yes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me make sure there's no other combination. For example, using multiplication. Let's see: 24 * something. 24 * 2 is 48, which is close to 45. But how to get 2 from the other numbers? 90 - 87 is 3, and 24 - 24 is 0. Not helpful. Or 90 divided by something? 90 divided by 2 is 45, but how to get 2? Maybe 87 - 24 - 24 = 39, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nAnother thought: 7 + 15 is 22, and 36 - 22 is 14. So 36 - (7 + 15) = 36 -22 =14.

Let's check the total sum of all numbers. 83 + 3 + 79 + 82 = 247. That's way higher than 89, so subtraction might be needed. \n\nWhat if I combine some numbers to reduce the total? For example, 83 and 82 are close to 89. 83 + 82 is 165. Then 165 minus something. But 165 - 79 is 86, and then 86 +3 is 89. Wait, let me check that. \n\nSo 83 + 82 = 165. Then 165 - 79 = 86. Then 86 +3 = 89. But that uses all four numbers: 83, 82, 79, 3. So the equation would be (83 + 82) - 79 + 3. Let me compute that: 83+82 is 165, minus 79 is 86, plus 3 is 89. Yes! That works. \n\nWait, but the order of operations might matter. Let me make sure. The expression is (83 + 82) - 79 + 3. Since addition and subtraction are left associative, it's 83 + 82 -79 +3.

But that uses all three numbers. Let me check: 89 + 29 - 29. Yes, that's 89. But wait, does that count as using each number once? The problem says each number can only be used once. So using 89 once, and then 29 twice. But the list is [29, 29, 89], so each of the three numbers must be used once. So in this case, the equation would be 89 + 29 - 29. But that's allowed because each number is used once. Wait, the numbers are two 29s and one 89. So using each once. So the equation would be 89 + 29 - 29. That equals 89. So that's a valid solution. But maybe there's another way? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 89 - 29 - 29. That's 89 - 58 = 31, which is not 89. So no. Or 29 * (something). But 29 * 3 is 87, which is close. But how to get 3 from the remaining numbers? If I have 89 and 29, maybe 89 - 29 = 60, then 60 + 29 = 89. But that would use 89, 29, and 29 again. So 89 - 29 + 29 = 89. Which is the same as the first solution. So yes, that's the same equation. So the answer is 89 + 29 - 29.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply some numbers. 4 and 2 can be multiplied to get 8. Then 95 plus 41 is 136. If I add 8 to 136, that's 144. Still too high. What if I subtract 4 from 136? 136 - 4 is 132, then add 2? 134. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 95 plus 4 is 99. Then add 2 and 41. That would be 99 + 2 + 41 = 142. No. Not close.\n\nWhat about 41 - 4 = 37. Then 95 + 37 is 132. Then 132 - 2 = 130. Still not 100.\n\nAnother approach: 95 is a big number. Maybe subtract something from it. 95 + 4 + 2 + 41 = 142. Need to reduce by 42. But how?\n\nWait, maybe divide. Let's see. If I take 95 and divide by something. 95 divided by 4 is 23.75. Not helpful. Or 41 divided by 2 is 20.5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 - 4 = 37. Then 95 - 37 = 58. Then 58 + 2 = 60. No.\n\nWait, maybe 95 + 4 = 99. Then 99 + (41 - 2) = 99 + 39 = 138. No.\n\nWhat if I multiply 4 and 2? 8.

Let me think about how to combine these numbers.\n\nFirst, I should check if any of the numbers can be combined in a way that gets me closer to 50. Let's look at the numbers: 94, 11, 72, 39. The largest number is 94, which is way bigger than 50. Maybe subtracting it from something? But then I need to use the other numbers to make up the difference. For example, 94 - something equals 50. That something would need to be 44. But how to get 44 from 11, 72, and 39?\n\nWait, 72 - 39 is 33. 11 plus 33 is 44. So if I do 94 - (72 - 39 + 11), that would be 94 - (33 +11) = 94 - 44 = 50. But wait, let me check that. Let me compute step by step. 72 - 39 is 33. Then 33 + 11 is 44. Then 94 - 44 is 50. Yes! But does that use all the numbers once? Let's see: 94, 72, 39, and 11. Yes, each is used once. The operations are subtraction and addition. So the equation would be 94 - (72 - 39 + 11) = 50. Let me check again. 72 - 39 is 33, plus 11 is 44. 94 minus 44 is indeed 50.

Let's check the largest numbers first. 87 is the biggest, but if I subtract something from it, maybe? 87 minus something equals 69? That would require 87 - 18 = 69. But how to get 18 from the other numbers? 48, 16, 64. Let's see. 48 divided by something? 48 divided by 2 is 24, but I don't have a 2. Alternatively, 64 minus 16 is 48.

That's another way. So 52 + 57 - 9 = 100. Let me check: 52+57 is 109, minus 9 is 100. Yes. That uses all three numbers. So that's another valid equation. So either (57 -9) +52 or 52 +57 -9.

Then 1 plus 41 is 42. Oh! Wait, that uses all three numbers: 86, 86, and 41. Let me check: (86 / 86) + 41 = 1 + 41 = 42. Yes! That works. So the equation would be (86 / 86) + 41. But I need to make sure each number is used once. The two 86s are used in the division, and 41 is used once. Yep, that's valid. So the answer should be that.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe goal is to use the numbers [86, 41, 86] once with basic operations to reach 42. First, notice that the two 86s can be divided: 86 ÷ 86 = 1.

But wait, the problem says to use each number once. So adding all three would be valid. But let me check if that's allowed. The example given in the problem was (1 + 2) * 3 - 4, which uses each number once. So yes, adding all three numbers would work here. But let me verify the math: 9 + 37 is 46, plus 29 is 75. Yes, that's correct. So the equation would be 9 + 37 + 29 = 75. But wait, the problem says \"create an equation that equals 75\" using the numbers. So that's straightforward. But maybe there's another way? Let me check if there's another combination. For example, maybe using multiplication or division. Let me see. 37 - 29 is 8, then 9 + 8 is 17, no. 37 - 9 is 28, 28 + 29 is 57. Not enough. 29 - 9 is 20, 37 + 20 is 57. Still not. What about multiplying two numbers? 9 * 37 is 333, way too big. 9 * 29 is 261, also too big. 37 * 29 is even bigger. Dividing? 37 / 9 is about 4.11, not helpful. 29 / 9 is about 3.22. Not sure. So maybe the simplest way is to add all three numbers. But wait, the problem says \"basic arithmetic operations\" which include addition. So adding all three is allowed.

So either way, the equation is 91 - 60 - 6 or 91 - 6 - 60. Both are the same. So the answer should be that. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. For example, using multiplication? If I multiply 6 and 60, that's 360.

But how to get 15 from 7 and 8? 7 + 8 is 15. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So 91 - (7 + 8) = 76. Let me check that. 7+8 is 15, 91-15 is 76. Yes! That works. So the equation would be 91 - 7 - 8. But wait, the numbers are 7, 91, and 8. So using each once. So 91 - 7 - 8 is 76. That's correct. \n\nBut let me confirm. 91 minus 7 is 84, then minus 8 is 76. Yep. So the equation is 91 - 7 - 8 = 76. That uses all three numbers once. So the answer should be that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to use the numbers [7, 91, 8] exactly once and apply basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value of 76. \n\nFirst, note that 91 is the largest number, and 76 is 15 less than 91. To find 15, we can add 7 and 8 (7 + 8 = 15). Subtracting this sum from 91 gives 91 - 15 = 76. This uses all three numbers exactly once and adheres to the constraints.\n\nThe final equation is:  \n<answer>91 - 7 - 8</answer>", "numbers": [7, 91, 8], "target": 76.0, "reward": 1.0, "equation": "91 - 7 - 8", "result": 76.0}

Then 38 minus 22 is 16. No. What if I do 38 minus (20 divided by 2)? 20 divided by 2 is 10, so 38 minus 10 is 28. Still not 36. \n\nHow about multiplying 2 and 20? That's 40. Then 40 minus 38 is 2. Not helpful. \n\nWhat if I use 38 and 2 first? 38 minus 2 is 36. Then I have 20 left. But I can't use 20 because I already used 38 and 2. Wait, no, each number can be used once. So if I do 38 - 2, that uses 38 and 2, and then I have 20 left. But I need to use all three numbers. So maybe that's not allowed. \n\nWait, the problem says to use each number once. So I have to use all three numbers in the equation. So I can't just use two of them. Let me think again.\n\nWhat if I do 20 + 2 = 22, then 38 - 22 = 16. No. Or 38 + 2 = 40, then 40 - 20 = 20. Not helpful. \n\nWhat about (38 - 20) = 18, then 18 + 2 = 20. No. \n\nWait, maybe multiplication. Let's see. 2 times 20 is 40.

I need to use the numbers 59, 11, and 34 to make 14. Each number can only be used once. Let's think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can subtract or add some numbers. Let's try combining them. Let's see, 59 minus 34 is 25. Then 25 minus 11 is 14. Wait, that works! So 59 - 34 = 25, then 25 - 11 = 14. But wait, that uses all three numbers: 59, 34, and 11. So the equation would be 59 - 34 - 11. Let me check the calculation: 59 minus 34 is 25, minus 11 is 14. Yes, that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't miss any other combinations. Are there other ways? Maybe using multiplication or division? Let's try. For example, 11 plus 34 is 45, then 59 minus 45 is 14. Oh, that's another way! So 59 - (11 + 34) = 14. Both approaches work. But the first one is straightforward. So either 59 - 34 - 11 or 59 - 11 - 34. Both are valid. Since the problem allows any order as long as each number is used once, either is correct. The example given in the prompt had a specific order, but the problem doesn't specify order. So either equation is acceptable. Let me confirm once more. 59 - 34 is 25, 25 -11 is 14. Yes. Alternatively, 59 -11 is 48, 48 -34 is 14. Also correct. So the answer could be written as 59 - 34 - 11 or 59 - 11 - 34. Both are valid. The user probably expects any correct answer. So I can choose either.

I need to use the numbers 71, 31, and 19 to make 21. Each number can only be used once, and I can use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.\n\nFirst, I should check if any combinations of these numbers can get close to 21. Let's think about possible operations. Maybe subtracting larger numbers? For example, 71 minus something. But 71 is quite big. If I subtract 31 from 71, that gives 40. Then 40 minus 19 is 21. Wait, that's 71 - 31 - 19. Let me check that: 71 -31 is 40, 40-19 is 21. Yes! That works. But wait, does that use all three numbers? Yes, 71, 31, and 19 each once. So the equation would be 71 - 31 - 19 = 21. Let me verify: 71 minus 31 is 40, minus 19 is 21. Correct. So that's the solution. But maybe there's another way? Let me see. For example, 19 + 31 is 50, then 50 minus 71 is -21, which isn't helpful. Or 71 divided by something? 71 divided by 19 is about 3.7, not helpful. Maybe 31 minus 19 is 12, then 71 minus 12 is 59. No. So the first idea seems the only way. So the answer is 71 - 31 - 19 = 21.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to use each number [71, 31, 19] exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value of 21. \n\nFirst, consider subtracting the largest numbers:  \n- 71 - 31 = 40  \n- 40 - 19 = 21  \n\nThis sequence uses all three numbers once and results in 21. No other combinations of operations (e.g., multiplication, division) yield 21 with these numbers while adhering to the constraints.\n\n<answer>", "numbers": [71, 31, 19], "target": 21.0, "reward": 0.0, "equation": null, "result": null}

Then 58 + 15 is 73. 44 + 73 is 117, which is too big. Alternatively, 22 * 2 = 44, 58 - 15 = 43. 44 + 43 = 87, not enough.

For example, 90 divided by something. 90 divided by 6 is 15, but I don't have a 6. Wait, 58 and 64 are the other numbers. Maybe 64 minus 58 is 6. Then 90 divided by 6 is 15. Let me check that.\n\nSo 90 / (64 - 58) = 90 / 6 = 15. Yes! That works. Let me verify: 64 minus 58 is 6, then 90 divided by 6 is 15. That uses all three numbers once each. So the equation would be 90 / (64 - 58) = 15. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that each number is used exactly once. 90, 64, and 58 are all used here. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be that equation.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nTo create an equation equal to 15 using the numbers [90, 58, 64], we need to use basic arithmetic operations. First, note that 64 - 58 = 6. Then, 90 divided by 6 equals 15. This uses all three numbers once: 90, 64, and 58.

I need to use the numbers 22, 85, 46, and 4 exactly once each to make an equation that equals 11. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Hmm, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can be combined.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to reduce some numbers. For example, 22 and 46 are both larger numbers. If I subtract them, 46 - 22 is 24. Then maybe 85 minus 24 is 61, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe adding 22 and 4 gives 26, and then 85 minus 26 is 59, which isn't 11. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if I divide some numbers? Let's try. 85 divided by something? If I divide 85 by 4, that's 21.25. Not sure. How about 46 divided by 2? But I don't have a 2. Wait, maybe 4 divided by something. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: 11 is a small number. Maybe I can subtract larger numbers to get there. Like, 85 - 46 = 39. Then 39 - 22 = 17. Then 17 - 4 = 13. Not 11. Alternatively, 85 - 46 = 39, then 39 - 22 = 17, then 17 - 4 is 13. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers? 46 and 4: 46 * 4 is 184. Then 184 divided by something? If I divide by 22, that's 8.36... Not helpful. Or 85 minus 22 is 63, then 63 minus 46 is 17. No.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's see. If I can get a fraction that when combined with other numbers gives 11. For example, 46 divided by something. Let's think about 46 / 4 = 11.5. Close to 11. But then how to get that?

I need to use the numbers 49, 33, and 71 exactly once each to make 87 with basic arithmetic operations. Hmm.

If I subtract 71 from 82, that's 11, which isn't helpful. What if I do 71 + 33? That's 104. Then 104 minus 49 is 55.

Let's see. 71 divided by something? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations. Let's think of 87 as a target. Let's see if any of the numbers can be used in a way that gets close.

Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combining numbers in a different way. Let's see. 50 and 11. If I subtract them, 50 - 11 = 39. Then 82 minus 39 is 43. Not 21. Alternatively, 50 divided by something? 50 divided by 11 is about 4.54, which isn't helpful. \n\nWhat about multiplying? 11 times something? 11 * 2 is 22, which is close to 21. But how to get 2 from 82 and 50? 82 - 50 is 32. 32 divided by something? Not sure. Alternatively, 50 - 82 is -32. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 82 - 50 = 32. Then 32 minus 11 is 21. Oh! Wait, 82 minus 50 is 32, then 32 minus 11 is 21. So that would be (82 - 50) - 11 = 21. Let me check: 82-50 is 32, 32-11 is 21. Yes! That works. But wait, does that use each number once? 82, 50, and 11 are all used once. So the equation would be 82 - 50 - 11 = 21. But let me verify the arithmetic again. 82 minus 50 is 32, minus 11 is 21. Yep.

Or 78 - 52 is 26, then 63 - 26 is 37. No.\n\nMaybe multiply some numbers. Let's see. 78 divided by something? 78 divided by 6 is 13, but I don't have a 6. Alternatively, 63 divided by 21 is 3. So maybe 63/21 = 3. Then 78 - 3 = 75. Then 52 - 75 is negative. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 52 - 21 is 31. Then 63 + 31 is 94. Then 78 - 94 is -16. Not useful.\n\nWait, maybe 78 + 52 = 130. Then 130 - 63 = 67. Then 67 + 21 = 88? Wait, 67 +21 is 88. But that would require using 78,52,63,21. Let me check: 78 +52 is 130, minus 63 is 67, plus 21 is 88. But that uses all four numbers once. But the operations are +, -, +. So the equation would be (78 + 52) - 63 + 21. Let me compute that: 78", "numbers": [78, 52, 63, 21], "target": 88.0, "reward": 0.0, "equation": null, "result": null}

If I subtract them, 45 - 15 is 30. Then 30 minus 36 would be -6. That's not helpful. What if I divide? 45 divided by 15 is 3. Then 36 minus 3 is 33.

If I subtract something from it, maybe? But 87 is way larger than 22. Maybe dividing or multiplying?\n\nWait, 16 and 13 are closer to 22. 16 + 13 is 29, which is more than 22. 16 - 13 is 3. Then maybe 87 and 9? 87 - 9 is 78. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I use division? Let's see. 87 divided by something? 87 divided by 9 is 9.666... Not helpful. 16 divided by 9 is about 1.777. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining numbers in a different way. Let's see: 9 and 13. 9 + 13 is 22. Wait, that's already the target! But then I have 87 and 16 left. How do I use them? Because I can't use them unless I do something with them. But if I have 9 + 13 = 22, then I need to make sure that 87 and 16 are not part of the equation. But the problem says each number can only be used once, so I can't leave them out. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use all four numbers. So, perhaps combining them with operations. Let me think. Let's see:\n\nIf I take 16 and 13, maybe subtract them: 16 - 13 = 3. Then 87 and 9. How can I use those? 87 - 9 = 78, then 78 + 3 = 81. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 87 - 16 = 71. Then 71 - 13 = ", "numbers": [87, 9, 16, 13], "target": 22.0, "reward": 0.0, "equation": null, "result": null}

So that would be 99 - (83 - 47 - 3). Wait, but that would be 99 - (36 -3) = 99 -33 = 66. But let me check if that uses all numbers. 99, 83, 47, and 3. Yes, each once. But the equation would be 99 - (83 - 47 - 3). Let me compute that: 83 -47 is 36, minus 3 is 33, then 99-33 is 66. That works. But let me see if there's another way, maybe with multiplication or division, but maybe this is the simplest.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another combination. Let me check. For example, 47 plus 3 is 50. Then 99 minus 50 is 49. Then 83 minus 49 is 34. Not helpful. Alternatively, 83 - 47 is 36. 99 - 36 is 63. Then 63 + 3 is 66. Oh, that's another way! So 99 - (83 - 47) + 3. Let's compute that: 83-47 is 36, 99-36 is 63, 63+3 is 66. Yes! So that uses all numbers: 99, 83, 47,", "numbers": [99, 3, 83, 47], "target": 66.0, "reward": 0.0, "equation": null, "result": null}

But wait, the problem says each number can be used once. So 71, 43, and 12 each used once. So that would be 71 - 43 - 12. Let me compute that: 71 - 43 is 28, then 28 -12 is 16. Yes! That works.

But wait, that's 92 -11 is 81, minus 19 is 62. Yes. But the problem says each number can be used once. So using 92, 11, and 19 once each. So the equation is 92 - 11 - 19 = 62. Alternatively, maybe parentheses to show the order, but the operations are subtraction. So the answer would be 92 - 11 - 19. Let me check if that's correct. 92 minus 11 is 81, minus 19 is 62. Yep. So that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nTo solve 92 - 11 - 19 = 62, we start by calculating the sum of 11 and 19, which is 30. Subtracting this from 92 gives 62.

Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can find two numbers that when combined give a smaller number, and then combine with others. Let's check the differences. For example, 94 is a big number. If I subtract something from it, maybe? 94 - 32 = 62. That's too big. 94 - 42 = 52. Still too big. 94 - 39 = 55. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I divide?

So multiplication might not be the way.\n\nWhat about subtracting two numbers? Let's see. Let's try 94 - 42 = 52. Then 52 - 39 = 13. Then 13 + 32 = 45. Nope.

Not 19.\n\nWait, maybe division. Let's think. If I can get a fraction that when added or subtracted gives 19. For example, 94 divided by something. Let's see. 94 divided by 42 is about 2.238. If I subtract that from 32? 32 - 2.238 is 29.76. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 39 minus something. 39 - 42 = -3.

I need to use the numbers 33, 61, and 74 exactly once each with basic operations to make 46. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try adding some numbers. 33 + 61 is 94, which is way higher than 46. 33 + 74 is 107, still too big. 61 + 74 is 135. So adding any two numbers gives a result that's way over 46. So maybe subtraction or division is needed.\n\nWhat if I subtract? Let's see. If I take 74 - 33, that's 41. Then 41 + 61 would be 102. Not helpful. Alternatively, 61 - 33 is 28. Then 28 + 74 is 102. Still too big. What if I subtract two numbers? Like 74 - 61 = 13. Then 13 + 33 = 46! Wait, that works. Let me check: 74 - 61 is 13, plus 33 is 46. Yes! So the equation would be 33 + (74 - 61) = 46. But wait, the numbers have to be used once each. So 33, 61, 74 each used once. So that's valid. Let me confirm the calculation: 74 - 61 is 13, 13 + 33 is 46. Yes! So the equation is 33 + 74 - 61 = 46. Alternatively, written as 33 + (74 - 61). But I need to make sure that the order of operations is correct. Since adding and subtracting are left associative, it would be 33 + 74 - 61. Which is indeed 46. So that's the solution. Let me see if there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if any other combinations could work.

What if I combine some numbers differently?\n\nWhat if I multiply? Let's see. 13 * 5 is 65, but I don't have a 5. Wait, maybe 61 - 51 is 10, and 62 - 13 is 49. 10 + 49 is 59. Still not 63. How about 62 + 13 = 75. 75 - 61 = 14, 14 - 51 = -37. No good.\n\nWait, maybe division? Let's think. 61 divided by something? 61 divided by 13 is about 4.69. Not helpful. Maybe 51 divided by something. 51 divided by 13 is around 3.92. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining two numbers and then using others. Let's try 61 + 13 = 74. Then 74 - 62 = 12. 12 + 51 = 63! Wait, that's possible. Let me check: 61 + 13 is 74, subtract 62 gives 12, then add 51. So 61 + 13 - 62 + 51. Let me compute that: 61 +13 is 74, minus 62 is 12, plus 51 is 63. Yes! That works.

Let's see: 90 plus 51 is 141, which is way higher than 97. 90 plus 58 is 148, still too big. So maybe subtraction? Let's try 90 minus something. 90 - 51 is 39, then 39 + 58 would be 97.

Let's think. If I subtract 58 from 58, that gives 0. Then I have 49 and 0. But 49 plus 0 is 49. Wait, but that would use both 58s and the 49. So the equation would be 58 - 58 + 49 = 49.

I need to use the numbers 94, 95, and 84 exactly once each to make an equation that equals 85. The allowed operations are basic arithmetic: plus, minus, multiply, divide. \n\nFirst, I should think about how these numbers can combine. Let me list them: 94, 95, 84. The target is 85. Hmm. Since 85 is a relatively small number compared to the other numbers, maybe I need to subtract or divide some of them.\n\nLet me try subtracting. If I take 95 and subtract 94, that gives 1. Then 1 plus 84 would be 85. Wait, that's 95 - 94 + 84. Let me check that: 95 -94 is 1, plus 84 is 85. Yes! But wait, the numbers used here are 95, 94, and 84. Each used once. So that would work. So the equation would be 95 - 94 + 84 = 85. \n\nBut let me verify. 95 minus 94 is 1, plus 84 is 85. Yes. That's correct. So that's the solution. Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems straightforward. Let me check if there's any other combination. For example, 84 plus something. 84 + 94 is 178, which is way bigger than 85. 84 minus 94 is -10, then adding 95 would be 85. So 84 - 94 + 95. That's 84 -94 is -10, plus 95 is 85. So that's another way. But both ways are valid. But the first one I thought of was 95 -94 +84. Either way, both are correct. So the answer would be either of those. Let me check if the operations are allowed. Yes, subtraction and addition are allowed. So both equations are valid. \n\nBut the problem says to use each number once. So both solutions use all three numbers once. So either is acceptable.

Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 99 is 100 - 1. Maybe find a way to get 100 and subtract 1. Let's see. 59 + 61 is 120. Then 120 - (11 + 18) = 120 - 29 = 91. Not 99. Or 120 - 11 - 18 = 91. Still no.\n\nWhat about 59 + 11 = 70. Then 70 + 18 = 88. 88 + 61 = 149. Nope. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. Let's think. 18 * 5 is 90, but I don't have a 5. 11 - (something) = ... Maybe 61 - 59 = 2. Then 18 + 11 = 29. 29 + 2 = 31. Not helpful.\n\nWait, 61 - 11 = 50. 59 - 18 =", "numbers": [59, 61, 11, 18], "target": 99.0, "reward": 0.0, "equation": null, "result": null}

If I subtract, like 47 - 17 = 30, then 30 + 54 = 84. Oh! Wait, that's 47 -17 +54. Let me check that: 47-17 is 30, plus 54 is 84. Yes! That works. But wait, the numbers can only be used once. So 47, 17, and 54 each used once. So the equation would be 47 -17 +54. Let me compute that again: 47-17 is 30, plus 54 is 84. Yes! That's correct. But wait, does that use all three numbers once? Yes. So that's the solution. But let me check if there's another way, but maybe this is the simplest. Alternatively, maybe multiplying? Let's see. 54 divided by something? 54 divided by 17 is about 3.17, not helpful. 17 times 4 is 68, but 4 isn't in the numbers. Hmm. Maybe 54 - 47 =7, then 17 +7=24, no. Not helpful. So the first idea seems correct. So the equation is 47 -17 +54. But let me check if the order matters. Since addition is commutative, it's the same as 54 +47 -17. So that's correct. So the answer should be 47 -17 +54. But I need to make sure that the operations are allowed. The problem says basic arithmetic operations, so subtraction and addition are allowed. Yes. So this should work.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nTo solve the problem, we need to use each number (17, 47, 54) exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /", "numbers": [17, 47, 54], "target": 84.0, "reward": 0.0, "equation": null, "result": null}
