I need to use the numbers 60, 89, and 82 to make 53. Each number can only be used once. Let me think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract some numbers. Let's check the differences. 89 minus 82 is 7. Then 60 minus 7 is 53. Wait, that would be 60 - (89 - 82) = 60 -7 = 53. But does that use all three numbers? Let me check: 60, 89, and 82. Yes, each is used once. So the equation would be 60 - (89 - 82) = 53. Let me verify that: 89-82 is 7, 60-7 is 53. Yep, that works. So the answer should be that.\n</think>\n\n<answer>60 - (89 - 82)</answer>", "numbers": [60, 89, 82], "target": 53.0, "reward": 1.0, "equation": "60 - (89 - 82)", "result": 53.0}
